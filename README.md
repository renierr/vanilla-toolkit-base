## Syncing with the Template

To update your project with the latest changes from the template, use the provided `sync_with_template.sh` script:

1. Make sure you have Bash and Git installed.
2. Run the script from your project root:
   ```sh
   ./sync_with_template.sh
   ```
3. The script will fetch updates from the template repository and apply them to your project. 
If there are conflicts, follow the on-screen instructions to resolve them.

This helps keep your project up-to-date with improvements and fixes from the template.
